                <h4><strong>Bread Recipe</strong></h4>
                <p><small>Soft bread is soft because CO2 produced by yeast and water that gets turned to steam by the baking process gets trapped into pockets by a mesh of gluten, causing the dough to expand.</small> </p>

                <h4><strong>Beef Recipe</strong></h4>
                <p><small>Chuck meat is your best bet for beef stew, but it's also a pretty tough cut so it needs time to break down and become tender. Rush the cooking process and the beef will be tough and chewy.</small></p>
